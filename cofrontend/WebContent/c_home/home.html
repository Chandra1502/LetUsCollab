						<h3>Things We Love About Winter. For Real.</h3>
						<p>Oh geez, guys. Wind Chill-acolypse 2017 was sort of a
							bummer in all the worst ways, especially for those of us who had
							to work Monday and Tuesday. But it wasn't all bad. In fact, Wind
							Chill-acolypse 2017 reminded us of a lot of things we actually
							love about winter in Columbus.

						<h3>6 Health Benefits of Having Pets</h3>
						<p>About 65 percent of American households have pets, and we
							spend nearly $35 billion dollars a year on these companion
							animals. (Lucky dogs.) Our pets clearly have us wrapped around
							their little paws, but what do we get from them in return?</p>

	<b>Collaboration in the workplace</b> is when two or more people (often groups) work together through 
	idea sharing and thinking to accomplish a common goal. It is simply teamwork taken to a higher level. 
	Teamwork is often a physical joining of two people or a group to accomplish a task. With the changes 
	and advancements in technology, such as high speed Internet, web-based programs, file sharing, email 
	and video-conferencing, collaboration has become a more productive way of doing things. Collaboration 
	in the workplace incorporates teamwork and several other aspects, such as the following: 
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Thinking and brainstorming ideas to provide solutions -</b> This key element brings groups together to offer different perspectives and expertise to solve for common problems. The phrase 'putting our heads together' would be a good example of this important element of collaboration. </li>
	<li><b>A strong sense of purpose -</b> Groups and individuals who truly collaborate see the value in working together. Collaboration is not forced upon someone. There should be a meaningful reason for working together, and it should benefit both parties or the company as a whole. </li>
	<li><b>Equal participation -</b> In corporate America, a collaborative manager or leader may often say, 'leave your titles at the door.' Treating everyone as equals when collaborating can open up communication and encourage ideas from all levels of the company or department, not just the managers or directors.</li>
	</ul>
